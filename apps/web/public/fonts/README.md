# Fonts Directory

This directory can contain custom font files for the cyberpunk theme.

For Three.js Text3D, you need JSON font files. You can generate them from:
- https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/

Or use the default fonts from Three.js examples:
- https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrdoob/three.js@master/examples/fonts/
